### TODO
- [ ] Implement webrtc to allow audio connection between clients
- Because all clients need to talk to each other a mesh network is needed.
- Using MCU can work but not possible for a personal project.

- [ ] Implement disconnection 
- A client disconnection doesn't reflect in current method of updating client avator 

### Known bugs
Start Game status event doubles on every call (can't find out why yet)
